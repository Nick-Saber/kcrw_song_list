This project is a python script which when run will record the most recent song played on KCRW's normal radio station or KCRW's Eclectic 24 station. 

Left to implement 
-
* Date querying so given a time and date script searches for the song
* Checking Validity of Shows i.e. if the show is a scheduled break or not
